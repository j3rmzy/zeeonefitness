      <p>Fitness has been a lifestyle for me since junior school when my obsessive desire to win had me go out and seek further training to further better myself. At a young age I was fortunate enough to play Junior National rugby at U18s and U20s, played junior cricket at County level and also held 100m and 200m sprinting records. </p>
      <br/>
      <p>As a young adult I joined the Army where again, I represented the Army at rugby and  cricket, and played rugby in the national leagues. The different sports I played and the varying demands of being a soldier opened my eyes to a variety of training methods at an exceptionally high level. My desire to be the best pushed me to learn as much as I could and understand the many different ways I could achieve my goals...... To be fitter, stronger, faster. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Through  the sports I played and Army training, I developed ‘A Mindset’. It’s my firm belief that the difference between being fit and healthy and NOT being fit and healthy is ‘A Mindset’. It’s this mindset I focus on in training which opens the door to achieving all our goals, whether it’s dieting, losing weight, getting stronger or performing to the best of your ability. What I offer is persistence and drive. That, coupled with your hard work and dedication, I can guarantee we’ll smash any goal we set ourselves.</p>

    <h2 class='heading1'>Why train with me?</h2>

      <p>I have always been fit and I did it with my mindset. I always pushed for more and didn’t stop until I got there. I also understand the importance of balance. Something I learned in the Army. A mentality of Work Hard, Play Hard. My aim is to give you that balance, where you are able to do whatever you want. A healthy work, life and social balance. You SHOULD NOT have to starve yourself on unsustainable diets, you SHOULD be able to go out for drinks with friends without having to worry about calories in a glass of wine and to be able to go out and be active with your family and friends. Whether it’s taking part in a marathon, playing in the park with your children and grandchildren, or signing up to a local sports club.</p>
